```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


- Take the first faceted plot in this section:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
advantages:
Every chart can be observed separatly
disadvantages:
Graphs are smaller. Too many graphs, especially if you have large dataset


- Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

```{r, out.width=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("plots/fig", 1:6, ".png"))

```
```{r graph1, out.width=200}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r graph2, out.width=200}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, class = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r graph3, out.width=200}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r graph4, out.width=200}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = FALSE)
```

```{r graph5, out.width=200}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
```

```{r graph6, out.width=200}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

- Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

- Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

Both are helpful when data overlaping exists. They help to distinguish many points on the same place. 
Geom_ponit maps the count to point area
Geom_jitter adds random values to the points, so that they are not on the same location anymore. 

- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg (fuel consumption)? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

The relationship is linear
coord_fixed() - scales the graph,it is responsible for x and y axes ratio.
geom_abline() - adds the line below, what is capable of showing the trend. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```

- What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()?
It is geom_pointrange

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?


- What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group.
geom_col()  - heights of the bars to represent values in the data

- What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?
it presents common value. Different smooth functions are available  y ~ x, y ~ poly(x, 2), y ~ log(x)


- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?

We cannot see the relationship between different classes, so we do not know what part Fair/D makes from all amount
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
```
